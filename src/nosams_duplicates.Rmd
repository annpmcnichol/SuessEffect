```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

glodap <- read_csv(here("data/glodapv2MMF.csv"))
expcodes <- read_delim(here("data/expocodes.txt"), 
                       delim = "\t", 
                       col_names = c("num", "cruise"))

Let's find field duplicates for Ann. This only takes samples that are the same bottle with different rec_nums.

```{r}
field_dups <- nosams %>% 
  group_by(expocode, station, cast, bottle) %>%
  mutate(N = n()) %>%
  filter(N > 1,
         length(unique(rec_num)) > 1) %>%
  arrange(rec_num)
```

Why not lab dupes while we're at it? These are samples that have multiples of the same receipt number, which are presumably the same water.

```{r}
recnum_dups <- nosams %>% 
  group_by(rec_num) %>%
  mutate(N = n()) %>%
  filter(N > 1) %>%
  arrange(rec_num)
```
