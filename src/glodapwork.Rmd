Working with GLODAP data...

Load the data. 

```{r}
# Load using read_csv
gv2 <- read_csv(here("data/glodapv2MMF.csv"))

exp <- read_tsv(here("data/expocodes.txt"), col_names = c("cruise", "expocode"))

gv2 <- inner_join(gv2, exp)
```
```{r}

```

Select just P15S

```{r}
p15s <- gv2 %>%
  filter(expocode == "096U20160426")
```

No results = P15S isn't in GLODAP

Lets try something that should be in both nosams and glodap
```{r}
head(gv2)
```

How about cruises that actually took 14CDIC? We should probably do a bulk conversion of "-999" values to R's "NA"...

```{r}
gv2c <- gv2 %>%
  filter(c14 != -9999)

head(gv2c)
```
