```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Joining the GLODAP and NOSAMS data now takes place in joinNOSAMSGLODAP.R. This file is now primarily for investigating the joined data and making sure the join makes sense.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(here)
```

Using a left join to retain all nosams, but we're missing a fair amount of data from GLODAP. Why?

```{r}
joined_dic <- read_csv(here("data/nosams_glodap.csv"))
str(joined_dic)
```

Let's troubleshoot. Find the unique expocodes from both datasets and see where they overlap and where they don't.

```{r}
summary(nosams)
glodap_expo <- unique(glodap_dic$expocode)
nosams_expo <- unique(nosams$expocode)
nosams_expo
```

```{r}
ggplot(joined_dic, aes(collection_time, f_modern)) +
  geom_point()
```
